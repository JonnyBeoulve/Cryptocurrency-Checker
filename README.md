# Cryptocurrency Checker
This is a React Redux website that displays trending cryptocurrencies and provides pricing information. Users will be able to register and signin to follow and track cryptocurrencies of their choice. Files are served by a back-end built in Node/Express, with a MongoDB database that stores a hashed user login and cryptocurrency preferences.
