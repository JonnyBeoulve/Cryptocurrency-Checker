# Cryptocurrency Checker
This is an in-development React Redux app that will display trending cryptocurrencies and provide pricing information. Users will be able to register and log-in to follow and track cryptocurrencies of their choice. Files are served by a back-end built in Node/Express, with a MongoDB database that stores user login and cryptocurrency preferences.

## How to Use
1. From terminal, install node dependencies by typing 'npm install' in the 'src/client' folder.
2. Type 'npm start' in the 'src/client' folder to initiate the program.
3. You can interface with the program by visiting 'http://localhost:3000'.

## Note
This is an in-development app that will soon be hosted on Heroku. The front-end and back-end are working, although several features are yet to be implemented, including the complete account page, cryptocurrency following, and login authentication.
